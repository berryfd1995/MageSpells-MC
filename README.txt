Hello everyone! Thank you for downloading MageSpells_Remastered.
Here I will be providing multiple updates of things to note.

So whats different?
No more stuck to primary and seconday, any spell can be primary or secondary.
Aura spells will now be cast at END of spell path. (If you wand it to be in one spot, set travel distance to 0)
Spray and Bolt still act the same. But just easier to tell what does what.
There is now a cooldown and charge time
-Charge time happens before a spell casting
-Cooldown time happens after a spell casting
There is now a user interface!!!
This will make it much easier to know what is going on.
The spell and wand ui update with the spells/wands you can use.
Wand bag stores your wands
Mage stats displays simple info
Binding manager allows you to bind spells to wand in a much easier fasion.
(If your spell or wand doesn't show up, you haven't unlocked it yet).
Custom items will be implemented more soon. Right now they can be used for wand costs.
New levels for using spells. (Enabled leveling is set by default and is currently broken)
Teams can now be created or destroyed easier. -- No more messy and confusing permission system.


What is next?
This is not a complete build. So these features will not be avaliable.
